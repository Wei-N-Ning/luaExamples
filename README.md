Lua Programming Examples
========================


All the examples here are inspired by the book Programming in Lua, 4th
 edition. 
 
They show the basic programming patterns in Lua, and how to use its 
programming constructs, data structures to solve common problems.

For examples that show Lua-C/C++ integration and highlevel pipelining,
